 * Certain objects contain state that is "shared" or visible to
 * multiple threads. If copied, the state in the new copy will become
 * stale and irrelevant. (Imagine a copy of a barrier. What will a
 * thread wait on in the copied barrier? Yes there are ways to fix
 * this, but jeeze, let's keep it simple for once.
