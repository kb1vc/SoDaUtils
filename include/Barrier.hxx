/**
 * @page SoDa::Barrier Barrier: A simple std::thread barrier 
 *
 *
 * It can't get much simpler. There's an example in examples/BarrierExample.cxx
 *
 * Here's what happens in the example:
 *
 * Create a barrier. 
 * 
 * The barrier is initialized to expect "num_threads + 1" or six
 * threads to wait on the barrier. (In this example, one for each
 * thread we create, and one for the parent thread.) All threads will
 * wait at the barrier until all of the waiters have called `wait`.
 * 
 * \snippet BarrierExample.cxx  create the barrier
 * 
 * Pass it to all of the threads. 
 * 
 * \snippet BarrierExample.cxx create threads
 * 
 * In this example, we pause one second before creating each
 * thread. (There are some messages that the full example prints to
 * show that things are happening.) The `sleepOneSecond` is *not* necessary. 
 * 
 * Each of the threads can then wait at the barrier, and stay there
 * until all six waiters have arrived. In this first wait, the threads
 * will wait forever, if necessary. This is often a reasonable thing
 * to do, as timeouts are almost always a maintenance and debug issue.
 * 
 * \snippet BarrierExample.cxx wait at the barrier
 *
 * But some applications need to do something when bad things
 * happen. A thread can wait, but set a timeout. If the timeout
 * expires, the `wait` method will throw a SoDa::Barrier::Timeout exception at the
 * waiter that timed out. All other waiters will get a SoDa::Barrier::Corrupt
 * exception to let them know that the barrier is broken.
 *
 * Here's how to wait, but bail out after one minute. (That's a little
 * impatient, in my book. But if you are writing a flight control
 * system, one minute might be a little long.)

 * > Hey! Why are you using
 * > this code in a flight control system? Sure the BSD license allows

 *
 *  In any case, here's how to wait,
 * but timeout if waiting lasts longer than a minute.
 * 
 * \snippet BarrierExample.cxx wait at the barrier with timeout
 * 
 * That's it. The barrier will get cleaned up when everybody lets the
 * barrier pointer go out of scope, or reassigns it. (Underneath the
 * covers BarrierPtr is a std::shared_ptr<Barrier>.)  But that has an
 * important aspect to it. If the barrier is set up to wait for N
 * threads, then N threads have to call wait before any caller can go
 * forward.
 * 
 * The devious among you will have noticed that the barrier doesn't
 * care *who* is waiting, just that it is the right number. And
 * BarrierPtr values can be passed around and shared. So it is
 * conceivable that a barrier created for 8 waiters might be known to
 * 10 threads. If 10 threads call wait, 8 of them will clear the
 * barrier, and the other two will have to wait until six more call
 * wait. So it isn't a good thing to do.  
 * 
 * We could fix that with a subscription mechanism, like with the
 * SoDa::MailBox class. But the flexibility might be worth the
 * danger. We'll find out, won't we?
 *
